// Here we define a function that uses the secant method to find roots of a function.
// In this function, we have inputs: fname, x0, x1, tol, and nmax. These are used to
// access the function, define two initial approximations to the root, provide a
// tolerance to the secant method, and provide a bound on the number of iterations.
// Which then outputs two functions: n and r, which contain (n) the total number of
// iterations and (r) the approximation of the root.
